# JourneyLocke

What is JourneyLocke? Essentially this is a challenge where I am going through each gen of pokemon as if it was one big Nuzlocke!

(Due to national dex restrictions in Sword and Shield this challenge will only go to Sun and Moon)

## Requirements To Move On To The Next Game

Effectively we have 1 major rules to win:

Beat The Elite 4

## Restrictions

- Typical Nuzlocke Rules: I can only catch 1 pokemon per route. If a pokemon dies it is gone forever

- No Legendaries are allowed to be used in our party

- No Healing Items/Status Cure items in Combat unless held.
  
- I cannot level up past the next major content. IE Rivals, Story events (Maxie, Giovini, etc etc), Gymleaders, and the Champion.

- Gym Rules:
  1. I cannot leave a gym once I enter (this is to make me premake a team)
  2. I cannot leave the gym till all of the trainers have been defeated
  3. I can only use the same amount of heals that the gym leaders have through the whole gym (excluding status cures)

## Moving To The Next Game

Upon moving to the next game I am allowed to take the pokemon that lived to see the hall of fame with me to the next game.

When I do, all pokemon will be de-evolved to their starting forms and begin at the starter pokemon level.

## Dying in a game

In typical Nuzlockes, when you white out, you lose. To keep this challenge from dying out in Sun and Moon due to one unlucky event, I am introducing lives, and these lives are represented by the pokemon who made it to the Hall of Fame alive. Every death will make me remove one of these Pokemon from my starting party until I either win or have no more left which then is a full reset back at FireRed/LeafGreen.
